# localFoodLearner
Was created to pick two dissimilar food options for the team to vote on

##General Algorithm Plan
1. Data is good if it is from within 3 months ago
2. Each vote (winning or losing) contributes to the pick pool
3. No two generated options share the same features (no two sandwich places)
4. Newly added places to eat are weighted higher when entering the pool
5. Winning selection from yesterday will not be in today's selection
